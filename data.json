Go to any relevant channel to your question and use the /poll command to conduct a simple poll.\n \nSaw a project in SASS and want to alert your colleagues to it? You can use the /alert command in any of the channels and choose whether it was a longform task or a supplemental task, enter however much information you have about the project, and I'll automatically direct your message to the <#{{sassalert}}> or <#{{supplementalalert}}> channel depending on what kind of task it was.\n \nAnd finally, if you have any suggestions about the Discord server, the issues you have in DTT that you'd like the Plint language managers to bring up during the meetings, a language or pool specific question or suggestion that you'd like to ask in your native language, or anything else, you can make suggestions or send inquiries using the /suggest command.\n \nYou can find all this information and more in the <#{{botcommands}}> channel.\n \nHappy subtitling!"
