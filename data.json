This is a waiting room for newcomers where you can set up your server profile and wait until an admin gives you access to the rest of the server.\n \nAll you have to do to set up your user profile is to:\n \n✅  Go back to the <#{{reception}}> channel by clicking on the channel name here.\n✅  Type `/usersetup`.\n✅  Press space and enter your name when prompted. If you use a different version of your name from what you have registered with Plint, you can include it in brackets (i.e. 'Jonathan (Jon) Smith' or 'Jonathan Smith (Jon)' ). But please make sure your username doesn't exceed 32 characters.\n✅  Press enter or tab and select your language from the list.\n✅  Press enter.\n \nIf your language is not listed there, please select @new language and wait for an admin to contact you for more details.\n \nAfter that, you can sit back and relax until an admin responds to your request. Once this happens, your nickname in the server is going to be automatically changed to the name you submitted. You will receive another message from me letting you know that you can now access the server, and I'm going to provide you with more information about how to use Discord and the server rules.\n \nHappy subtitling!",
