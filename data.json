If you're already familiar with Discord, maybe we could interest you in the <#{{channelindex}}> channel to see which channel is used for what, or you could check one of our linguists' reading speed manifesto in the <#{{readingspeed}}> channel, and read previous LM-Plint meeting recaps in the <#{{lmmeetingrecaps}}> channel.\n \nAlso, I come with a bunch of commands to help everyone make the best out of the server!\n \nTry /funfact command in the <#{{general}}> channel to learn a random fun fact about the server or its members.\n \nReach out to other subtitlers who speak a certain language for assistance by using the /available command in the <#{{globallinguisticsupport}}> channel and selecting the language you need.\n \nIf you're working on a project and want to collaborate with other people working on the same project, use /requestadd command in #project-channel-request and type in the exact name of the project you're working on to notify the admins, and wait for approval!\n \nAre you curious about what your colleagues think about a certain issue? Go to any relevant channel to your question and use the /poll command to conduct a poll.\n \nSaw a project in SASS and want to alert your colleagues to it? You can use the /alert command in any of the channels and choose whether it was a longform task or a supplemental task, enter however much information you have about the project, and I'll automatically direct your message to the <#{{sassalert}}> or <#{{supplementalalert}}> channel depending on what kind of task it was.\n \nAnd finally, if you have any suggestions about the Discord server, the issues you have in DTT that you'd like the Plint language managers to bring up during the meetings, a language or pool specific question or suggestion that you'd like to ask in your native language, or anything else, you can make suggestions using the /suggest command. As soon as you suggest something, you'll be sent a copy of your suggestion, and your suggestion will only be visible to you, and the admins or your language manager(s).\n \nYou can find all this information and more in the <#{{botcommands}}> channel.\n \nHappy subtitling!"

Press space, enter your name when prompted, press tab, select your language from the list, and press enter.\n \nAfter that, you can sit back and relax until an admin responds to your request. Once this happens, your nickname in the server is going to be changed to 'Name - Target Language' automatically. You will receive another message from me letting you know that you can now access the server, and I'm going to provide you with more information about how to use Discord and the server rules.\n \nHappy subtitling!",
